# US Holidays Angular App
This app combines [AngularJS 1.x](https://angularjs.org/), [UI-Router](https://ui-router.github.io/ng1/), [AngularJS Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/), and the [Holiday API](https://holidayapi.com/) to create a simple app that displays a list of US Holidays.

## Instructions
Download the repo and use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) (or your favorite tool) to serve the app on your local host.

## To Do

* Bundle assets with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and NPM.
* Add iconography to holiday detail view.
* Consider using a controller to display the public status of a holiday as a [chip](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/demo/chips).
* Consider verical sidebar nav with a list detail view similar to the [Angular Material starter project](https://github.com/angular/material-start/tree/es6-tutorial).
* Research best practices for including API keys client side.
